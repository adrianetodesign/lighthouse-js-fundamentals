/*
Concatenate Arrays

We've sent out two researchers to determine, on a scale of 1-10, 
how much people like lighthouses and they are hitting the streets 
of Canada to find out what people think. Both researchers have 
stored their numbers in array for each location. This means that 
we have two different arrays of data for every single location, 
but we only want a single array for each location. We're going to 
have to concatenate the arrays from both researchers into a single array.

Define a function called concat

The function should, when given two arrays, concatenate the arrays together.
